# Comparison of Methods to Inform K-Means Clustering: A Brief Tutorial

[Article in Towards Data Science describing the project](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/comparison-of-methods-to-inform-k-means-clustering-a830cdc8db50)

## Description

The purpose of the project was to compare implementations of k-means clustering informed by an elbow plot and a silhouette score. Prior to conducting the comparison, an exploratory data analysis was conducted and the data were cleaned and transformed as appropriate.

## Data

The data used in this project were retrieved from the University of California Irvines Machine Learning Repository. The original dataset was published in an article by K... et al. (2010). The dataset is comprised of 210 entries and eight variables. A brief description of the variables can be found below:
- Area:
- Length:
- Width:
- Compactness: $C = 4/piA / P^2 $
- Perimeter:
- Kernel Groove:
- Variety:
